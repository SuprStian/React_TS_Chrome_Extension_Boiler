# Getting Started with a Chrome extension with React and Typescript

This project was created by an adaptation of "create-react-app appname --template typescript" as a way to easily get started building a Chrome extension with React and Typescript.

The command "npm run build" will update the dist folder, which is the static files uploaded as an extension.
